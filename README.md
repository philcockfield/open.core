# Open.Core
Common utility functionality used between multiple applications.

[Live demo](http://opencore.herokuapp.com/harness).

## Setup
### Install using NPM

    npm install open.core

### Initialize
To initialize the **open.core** library from [Express](http://expressjs.com/):

```coffeescript

  express = require 'express'
  core    = require 'open.server'

  app = express.createServer()
  core.configure app
  app.listen 8000

```

### Tests

To run server side tests, from the `open.core` module folder: `$ cake specs`
Make sure Jasmine-Node has been installed globally: `npm install -g jasmine-node`

To run client-side tests in browser:

1. Configure **open.core** in your host application (see above).
2. Run tests in the browser at: `http://localhost:8000/core/specs`

To use the [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) test runner in the browser from your
host application:

```coffeescript

  core = require 'open.server'
  core.configure.specs app,
            title:      'My Specs'
            url:        '/specs'
            specsDir:   "#{__dirname}/specs/client/"
            sourceUrls: [
                '/javascripts/libs.js'
                '/javascripts/app.js' ]

```
