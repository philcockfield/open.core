#Open.Core
Common utility functionality used between multiple applications.

--------

### Install using NPM

    npm install open.core


### Initialize
To initialize the **Open.Core** library from [Express](http://expressjs.com/):

```coffeescript

  express = require 'express'
  core    = require 'open.core'

  app = express.createServer()
  core.configure(app)
  app.listen 8000

```


### Tests

To run server side tests, from the `open.core` module folder: `$ cake specs`

To run client-side tests in browser:

1. Configure **open.core** in your hosting application: `require('open.core').configure(app);`
2. Run tests in the browser at: `http://localhost:8000/core/specs`

To use the [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) test runner from your hosting application:

```coffeescript

  core = require 'open.core'
  core.configure.specs app,
            title:      'TestHarness Specs'
            url:        '/specs'
            specsDir:   "#{paths.specs}/client/"
            sourceUrls: '/javascripts/harness.js'


```
